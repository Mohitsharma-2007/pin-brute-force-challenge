## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database (optional - runs without database)
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pin-brute-force-challenge.git
   cd pin-brute-force-challenge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set environment variables** (optional)
   ```bash
   export SECRET_PIN=6942                    # Target PIN to crack
   export SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key     # Flask session key
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...      # PostgreSQL connection
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Web interface: http://localhost:5000
   - Attack tool: http://localhost:5000/attack
   - Database dashboard: http://localhost:5000/database

## üìñ Usage

### Web Interface Attack

1. Navigate to `/attack` in your browser
2. Enter the target URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/check`)
3. Configure attack parameters:
   - **Threads**: Number of concurrent workers (5-50)
   - **Delay**: Time between requests (0-1 seconds)
   - **Timeout**: Request timeout (3-30 seconds)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify target
5. Click "Start Attack" to begin brute forcing
6. Monitor real-time progress and results

### Command Line Attack

```bash
# Basic attack
python pin_cracker.py --url http://localhost:5000/check

# Advanced configuration
python pin_cracker.py \
  --url http://target.com/check \
  --threads 20 \
  --delay 0.1 \
  --timeout 10 \
  --verbose
```

### Manual PIN Testing

1. Visit `/challenge` for the interactive interface
2. Enter 4-digit PINs (0000-9999)
3. View immediate feedback on attempts
4. Track your manual guessing progress

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components
- **Flask Web Server**: Main application server with API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent storage for attack data and statistics
- **Multi-threaded Engine**: Queue-based task distribution for brute forcing
- **Session Management**: Thread-safe attack coordination

### Database Schema
- **AttackSession**: Complete attack session records with configuration
- **AttemptLog**: Individual PIN attempts during automated attacks
- **PinAttempt**: Manual PIN attempts via web interface
- **Statistics**: Application-wide metrics and analytics

### API Endpoints
- `POST /check`: PIN validation endpoint
- `GET /stats`: JSON statistics and metrics
- `POST /test-connection`: Target connectivity testing
- `GET /start-attack`: Server-sent events for live attack monitoring
